## Concept Overview
Lugawan Simulator is a short narrative cooking simulation game set in a humble Filipino lugawan.  
Players start by managing a cozy, lighthearted day serving comfort food to quirky regulars. As the story unfolds, the game shifts into a deeper, psychological exploration of memory, routine, and the quiet despair of feeding others while starving internally.
