# Lugawan Simulator (Working Title)

> *"Serve comfort. Face discomfort."*

**Lugawan Simulator** is a short narrative cooking simulation game set in a humble Filipino *lugawan*. What begins as a light, almost comedic day-in-the-life of a vendor slowly transforms into something much deeper—challenging players to reflect on memory, routine, and what it means to feed others while starving internally.
